# Crop Line Detection in a Field
## Description
This project is designed to detect crop lines in a field using image processing techniques with OpenCV. The algorithm analyzes an image to identify brown areas, which typically correspond to soil or cultivated regions, and then applies morphological operations to refine the detected areas. It then outlines significant clusters with a convex hull and a line to facilitate visual identification of the crop lines. Filtering is applied to remove small clusters, and the algorithm checks that the detected lines are sufficiently vertical and parallel.

##Features
Brown Area Detection: Identifies brown areas in the image, often associated with soil or crop lines.
Morphological Operations: Applies morphological operations to enhance the quality of the detected areas.
Convex Hull Enclosure: Wraps significant clusters with a convex hull to highlight their contours.
Line Drawing: Draws lines along the clusters to represent the crop lines.
Filtering: Removes small clusters to avoid false positives.
Verticality and Parallelism Check: Ensures that the detected lines are sufficiently vertical and parallel, maintaining consistency with expected crop lines.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- Numpy

## Usage
- Load an Image: Load the image of the field to be analyzed.

- Brown Area Analysis: The algorithm identifies brown areas, indicating the cultivated parts of the field.

- Morphological Operations: These operations (dilation, erosion, etc.) are applied to refine the detected brown areas.

- Cluster Detection: Significant clusters are identified and enclosed with a convex hull, and a line is drawn to represent the crop line.

- Cluster Filtering: Small clusters are removed to avoid detection errors.

- Verticality and Parallelism Verification: The detected lines are checked to ensure they are sufficiently vertical and parallel.

- Final Result: The resulting image shows the detected crop lines, highlighted and drawn, ready for further analysis or use in other applications.
